Saving the game
===============

In this tutorial we're going to get the game saving and loading. We'll introduce a start menu for
choosing between continuing and starting a new game, and we'll hook into ``love.quit`` to save the
game when we quit.

Dynamic ``GameLevelState`` constructor
--------------------------------------

First, we'll make ``GameLevelState`` accept a ``LevelBuilder`` *or* a ``Level``, for when it gets
deserialized. If it is a ``Level``, we pass it directly to the constructor.

.. code-block:: lua

   --- @overload fun(display: Display, level: Level|LevelBuilder, seed?: string): GameLevelState
   local GameLevelState = spectrum.gamestates.LevelState:extend "GameLevelState"

   --- @param display Display
   --- @param level Level|LevelBuilder
   --- @param seed string?
   function GameLevelState:__new(display, level, seed)
      if prism.LevelBuilder:is(level) then
         level:addSeed(seed)
         level:addSystems(
            prism.systems.SensesSystem(),
            prism.systems.SightSystem(),
            prism.systems.FallSystem()
         )

         -- Initialize with the created level and display, the heavy lifting is done by
         -- the parent class.
         self.super.__new(self, level:build(prism.cells.Wall), display)
      else
         self.super.__new(self, level, display)
      end
   end

Introductions
-------------

Head to ``modules/game/gamestates`` and create a new file ``gamestartstate.lua``.

.. code-block:: lua

   local controls = require "controls"

   --- @class GameStartState : GameState
   --- @field display Display
   --- @overload fun(display: Display): GameStartState
   local GameStartState = spectrum.GameState:extend("GameStartState")

   function GameStartState:__new(display)
      self.display = display
      self.save = love.filesystem.read("save.lz4")
   end

We import controls, because we'll use that a little later. All we do here is keep track of the
display, and try to read the savegame from disk. We're not saving it yet, so it won't exist and
that's okay!

.. code-block:: lua

   function GameStartState:draw()
      local midpoint = math.floor(self.display.height / 2)

      self.display:clear()
      self.display:print(1, midpoint, "Kicking Kobolds", nil, nil, nil, "center", self.display.width)

      self.display:print(1, midpoint + 3, "[n] for new game", nil, nil, nil, "center", self.display.width)

      local i = 0
      if self.save then
         i = i + 1
         self.display:print(1, midpoint + 3 + i, "[l] to load game", nil, nil, nil, "center", self.display.width)
      end

      self.display:print(1, midpoint + 4 + i, "[q] to quit", nil, nil, nil, "center", self.display.width)
      self.display:draw()
   end

Now we draw a really simple main menu. We put the title of the game and a few options below.

.. code-block:: lua

   function GameStartState:update(dt)
      controls:update()

      if controls.newgame.pressed then
         love.filesystem.remove("save.lz4")
         local builder = Game:generateNextFloor(prism.actors.Player())
         self.manager:enter(
            spectrum.gamestates.GameLevelState(self.display, builder, Game:getLevelSeed())
         )
      elseif controls.loadgame.pressed and self.save then
         local mp = love.data.decompress("string", "lz4", self.save)
         local save = prism.Object.deserialize(prism.messagepack.unpack(mp))
         Game = save
         self.manager:enter(spectrum.gamestates.GameLevelState(self.display, Game.level))
      elseif controls.quit.pressed then
         love.quit()
      end
   end

   return GameStartState

Lastly we'll wire up our options to controls. New game will delete the old save and restart the game
anew. Load will restore the save from disk and send us to our previous game. Quit quits the game.

One minor problem! We haven't actually defined these controls yet, so let's do that!

Controls
--------

Head over to ``controls.lua`` and add the following controls.

.. code-block:: lua

   newgame        = "n",
   loadgame       = "l",

Cleaning up main
----------------

Okay we've got our start screen and new controls defined. Let's get this actually showing up!
Navigate over to ``main.lua``.

Let's replace our ``love.load()`` function with the following:

.. code-block:: lua

   function love.load(args)
      if args[1] == "--debug" then
         local builder = prism.LevelBuilder()
         local function generator()
            Game:generateNegamextFloor(prism.actors.Player(), builder)
         end

         manager:push(spectrum.gamestates.MapGeneratorState(generator, builder, display))
      else
         manager:push(spectrum.gamestates.GameStartState(display))
      end

      manager:hook()
      spectrum.Input:hook()
   end

This will push our start screen to the stack when the game loads up. Now we need to modify Game a
bit to track a bit more state when saving/loading.

Modifying Game
--------------

Let's modify the class definition and constructor of Game.

.. code-block:: lua

   --- @class Game : Object
   --- @field depth integer
   --- @field lost boolean
   --- @field level Level?
   --- @overload fun(seed: string): Game
   local Game = prism.Object:extend("Game")

   --- @param seed string
   function Game:__new(seed)
      self.depth = 0
      self.rng = prism.RNG(seed)
      self.lost = false
   end

We're also going to modify how we expose Game. At the bottom of the file replace the line where we
return Game with the following:

.. code-block:: lua

   _G.Game = Game(tostring(os.time()))

Next, find any instances of ``require("game")`` in your code and remove it. Here we're creating a
global variable that contains the gamestate and can be easily replaced during serialization.

Losing and levels
-----------------

Now, let's make a few changes to ``GameLevelState`` and ``GameOverState``. We need them to track
what level we're on, and if we've lost the game.

First let's head over to ``modules/game/gamestates/gameoverstate.lua```.

Add the following line to the top of ``GameOverState:update``:

.. code-block:: lua

   function GameOverState:update(dt)
      Game.lost = true
      ...
   end

Now let's head over to ``modules/game/gamestates/gamelevelstate.lua``.

Add the following line to the top of ``GameLevelState:updateDecision``:

.. code-block:: lua

   function GameLevelState:updateDecision(dt, owner, decision)
      Game.level = self.level
      ...
   end

Saving the game
---------------

We're finally read to wire everything up. It's time to save the game. Head back over to
``main.lua``.

Add a ``require "game"`` to the top of the file.

.. code-block:: lua

   require "debugger"
   require "prism"
   require "game"

Now let's define a ``love.quit`` hook that will run when the game is stopped. We'll check if we
lost, and if so we'll delete any existing save and return. If we haven't lost we'll save the current
state of the game for the user's next session.

.. code-block:: lua

   function love.quit()
      if Game.lost then love.filesystem.remove("save.lz4") return end
      local save = Game:serialize()
      local mp = prism.messagepack.pack(save)
      local lz = love.data.compress("string", "lz4", mp)
      love.filesystem.write("save.lz4", lz)
   end

In the next chapter
-------------------

We'll use serialization in a different way, creating prefabs and using them to spice up level
generation!
